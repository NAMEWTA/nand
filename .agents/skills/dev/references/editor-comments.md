# Editor comments

Comments are a sidecar on the vault. The note file is never written by this feature. There is no PDF entry: extensions only run for markdown. The product boundary is SKILL rule 2.

## On-disk layout

```
.nand/editor/comments/index.json
.nand/editor/comments/files/<first 16 hex of sha256(path)>.json
```

- Hash the path string, not the file bytes, with `crypto.subtle` SHA-256, first 16 hex chars.
- `index.json` is `{ version: 1, files: { [path]: { hash, open, total, updatedAt } } }`.
- Each file doc is `{ version: 1, path, comments: CommentThread[] }`.
- Empty thread list deletes that sidecar file and the index entry.
- Writes are serialized on one promise chain and debounced (300ms). `flush()` runs on plugin unload and when the editor module turns off.
- `data.json` stores only `editorWorkbench` (`activeDomain`, `highlightEnabled`, `popoverEnabled`, optional `sidebarWidth`). Never a comment body. Normalization order is SKILL rule 10.

## Model

`CommentStatus`: `open` | `resolved` | `orphaned`.

`TextQuoteAnchor`: `exact`, `prefix`, `suffix`. Prefix and suffix are 24 characters. The quote is the source of truth. Offsets are a cache.

Thread ids look like `c-…`, message ids like `m-…`.

## Locating a quote

`locateAnchor` in `src/editor-view/comments/anchor.ts`:

1. If `doc.slice(start, end) === exact`, keep the offsets.
2. Else search `prefix + exact + suffix` once.
3. Else search `exact` and take the hit nearest the old start.
4. Else the caller sets `orphaned`.

Do not guess a nearby paragraph. Do not auto-reopen an orphaned thread when some later text happens to match. `reopen()` refuses orphaned threads. `reanchor()` is the explicit user action that binds a new selection and sets `open`.

`selectionIsCommentable` rejects a selection that starts inside YAML frontmatter or sits inside a fenced code block. Reading-mode highlights also skip `pre`, `code`, `script`, `style`, and existing `.nand-editor-comment-hl` nodes.

## Store rules

- `applyChanges` no-ops until `reconcile()` has run for that path. A keystroke during the initial load must not drag a stale offset.
- `reconcile` relocates open and resolved threads and marks misses `orphaned`. It does not rewrite quotes that only shifted.
- `applyChanges` maps offsets with `ChangeSet.mapPos`, refreshes the quote from the new document, and orphans a thread whose range collapses.
- Overlapping CodeMirror marks are dropped (advance the cursor to the end of the accepted mark). A mark is drawn only when `doc.slice` still equals `exact`.
- `renamePath` moves threads to the new path and rewrites the sidecar under the new hash.
- `deletePath` removes the index entry and the sidecar.
- Mutations go through the queue. `applyChanges` is synchronous on the cache and marks the path dirty.

## UI

- Source and live preview: CodeMirror `ViewPlugin` from `commentsCmExtension`. Highlights obey `highlightEnabled`. The selection popover obeys `popoverEnabled`. The add-comment command still works when the popover is off.
- Reading mode: `registerMarkdownPostProcessor`. If the file is not loaded yet, `loadFile` then rerender that preview once. Do not rerender again when the cache is already warm (that loops).
- Side panel: reply, resolve, reopen, delete, jump, reanchor. Jump switches preview to source, then `setSelection` and `scrollIntoView`.
- Closing the panel does not call `editorHost.onunload`. Extension lifetime is SKILL rule 11.
- Clicking a highlight focuses that thread (`store.focus`). It does not edit the note.

Cross-product event names live in `src/shared/events.ts`. `COMMENT_TO_TASK` is reserved: `commentToTaskPayload` shapes a payload and nothing dispatches it yet. `ACTIVE_FILE_COMMENTS_CHANGED` is declared and has no caller yet. Do not import the dashboard to create a task, and do not start emitting either event unless the task says so.

## Tests

`pnpm run test:editor-comments` bundles `scripts/verify-editor-comments.ts` with esbuild and the Obsidian stub. The runner shape is in `references/build-and-release.md`.

The script checks anchors, the in-memory filesystem (the note string is unchanged), index hash length 16, reply, resolve, rename, delete, orphan reconcile, the editor/dashboard import boundary, and the view type constants from the identity table.

- The bundle's `__dirname` is `node_modules/.tmp`. Resolve the repo with `process.cwd()`.
- `CommentStore` uses `window.setTimeout`. The test polyfills `window` on `globalThis` before constructing the store.

Add a case to this script when you change locate, serialization, or the boundary. Do not point the test at a real vault.
